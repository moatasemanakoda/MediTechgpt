Blood clots can form in the veins (deep vein thrombosis) or arteries (arterial thrombosis) and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. Treatment for blood clots may include anticoagulant medications (blood thinners) to prevent further clotting, thrombolytic therapy to dissolve clots, or surgical procedures to remove or bypass the clot. If you suspect you have a blood clot, seek medical attention immediately, as prompt treatment is essential to prevent complications."],

Treatment for low blood pressure depends on the underlying cause and severity of symptoms. In some cases, lifestyle modifications such as increasing salt intake, staying hydrated, wearing compression stockings, and avoiding alcohol and caffeine can help raise blood pressure. Medications such as fludrocortisone or midodrine may also be prescribed in certain situations. If you suspect you have low blood pressure, consult a primary care physician or cardiologist for evaluation and management."],
